Control-FREEC v7.2 : calling copy number alterations and LOH regions using deep-sequencing data
MT-mode using 10 threads
..Minimal CNA length (in windows) is 1
..consider the sample being female
..Breakpoint threshold for segmentation of copy number profiles is 0.8
..Polynomial degree for "ReadCount ~ GC-content" or "Sample ReadCount ~ Control ReadCount" is 3
..telocenromeric set to 50000
..FREEC is not going to adjust profiles for a possible contamination by normal cells
..Note, the Coefficient Of Variation won't be used since "window" = 1000 was set
..Output directory:	.
..Directory with files containing chromosome sequences:	/group/jrigrp4/freec/maize3/
..Sample file:	/group/jrigrp4/cn.mops/TIL_data/TIL01_sorted.bam
..Sample input format:	BAM
..will use this instance of samtools: 'samtools' to read BAM files
..Control file:	HCC1143_BL.arachne
..Input format for the control file:	BAM
..File with chromosome lengths:	/group/jrigrp4/freec/chrLenFile.txt
..uniqueMatch = FALSE
..average ploidy set to 2
..break-point type set to 2
..noisyData set to 0
..minimal number of reads per window in the control sample is set to 10

..samtools should be installed to be able to read BAM files; will use the following command for samtools: samtools view /group/jrigrp4/cn.mops/TIL_data/TIL01_sorted.bam
